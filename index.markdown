A collection or material and exercises for learning how to build web based systems using [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

A web based system, in my view, is one in which clients interact with a backend server using the HTTP protocol. Examples include Google's Gmail (client side portion is written in JavaScript and runs in a web browser), but also Twitter's [iPhone app](https://twitter.com/#!/download/iphone) (client side portion is written in Objective-C and runs on an iPhone), however this material focuses on clients that are developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This material is based on fundamental concepts such as the HTTP protocol and so no high-level framework (that hides those details) is used. In addition to the topics listed below, several cross-cutting topics (such as performance and security) get some coverage. Note that the exercises build on each other to some extent, so it makes some sense to work through this material in the following order.

1. [JavaScript and node materials](materials/javascript.html), [node hello world program](materials/node-hello.html) and [exercise](exercises/functions.html) 
* [HTTP requests materials](materials/requests.html) and [exercise](exercises/bench.html)
* [HTTP responses materials](materials/responses.html) and [exercise](exercises/server.html)
* Web application server basics
* HTML, the web's presentation layer
* SQL and persistence
* HTML forms and POST HTTP requests
* HTTP and state (session management)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
* DOM model and API
* Client side programming with jQuery
* Asynchronous HTTP requests (using jQuery)
* Overview of other topics (Frameworks, REST, Document stores, etc)

Here are some general references I find helpful:

* [JavaScript language guide and reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) from Mozilla.
* [Douglas Crockford's JavaScript talk](http://yuiblog.com/crockford/)
* [Node docs](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.2/api/)
* [jQuery docs](http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page)
